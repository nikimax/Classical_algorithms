# Classical algorithms

Most popular machine learning algorithms written only with numpy<br/>
In our projects we often need to modify common used algorithms in<br/>
in a way that is not supported by any packages.<br/>
The algorithms are written in the form of classes, and in the additional<br/>
part we compare them with similar functions from Sklearn<br/>
All models are divided into groups. I am constantly supplementing this<br/>
project with new implementations<br/>

### Classification tasks
1. [Decision Tree](./Decision_Tree.py)
2. [Supporting Vector Machine](./SVM.py)
3. [Naive Bayes Classifier](./Naive_Bayes_Classifier.py)
4. [K Nearest Neighbors](./KNN.py)

### Data preprocessing 
1. [Principal Component Analysis](./PCA.py)
2. [Linear Discriminant Analysis](./LDA.py)

### Boosting
1. [Ada Boost](./AdaBoost.py)
2. [Random Forest](./RandomForest.py)

### Clustering
1. [K-means](./K_Means.py)

### Regressions
1. [Linear Regression](./LinearReg.py)
